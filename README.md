# Python Code Library

This repository contains a library of useful Python code snippets. It also contains a number of Data Science projects using Jupyter notebooks and various libraries within the Anaconda distribution.

- They are intended to be relatively simple, and often highly contrived examples that can be built upon for inclusion in more complex real-life projects.
- They serve as syntax reminders and reference.
- They are highly documented so that they can be searched upon based upon keyword within GitHub and VS Code. In addition, this helps for future understanding of the code when revisiting and potentially integrating it within another project.
