This repository contains a library of useful Python code snippets.

It also contains a number of Data Science projects using Jupyter notebooks and various libraries within the Anaconda distribution. You can view them [here](https://github.com/WayneLambert/library-python/tree/master/data_science/notebooks).

**NOTES**

➔ The code snippets are intended to be highly contrived examples that can be built upon for inclusion in more complex real-life projects.

➔ They serve as syntax reminders, example use-cases, and general reference.

➔ They are highly documented so that they can be searched upon based upon keywords within either GitHub or your favourite code editor. In addition, this helps for future understanding of the code when revisiting and potentially integrating it within another project.
