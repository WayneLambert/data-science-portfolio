# Python Code Library

This repository contains useful Python code snippets.

- They are intended to be relatively simple, and often highly contrived examples that can be built upon for inclusion in more complex real-life projects.
- They serve as syntax reminders and reference.
- They are highly documented so that they can be searched upon based upon keyword from GitHub and the imminent GitHub mobile app.
