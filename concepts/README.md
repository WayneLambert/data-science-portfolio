# Code Snippets for Python Concepts

The code samples within this directory relate to examples of code that relate to concepts in Python or more generally in computer programming.

Sometimes the examples are contrived and they are intended to be highly documented with comments so that:

- I can review them down the line and understand what is going on in the code so they can be reused efficiently
- To make the source code file searchable within GitHub. This is especially useful with the improved search features that GitHub are releasing in addition to the new mobile apps
