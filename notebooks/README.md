Explore fascinating datasets using libraries such as _‘Pandas’_, _‘NumPy’_, _‘Matplotlib’_ and _‘Seaborn’_.

**PLEASE NOTE:** When opening one of the Jupyter notebooks, please give it a few moments for GitHub to open it as it may take a few seconds to render the page.

The notebooks are set up to install packages that are required in addition to those supplied in JupyterLab as standard.
