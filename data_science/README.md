A variety of Data Science projects used to demonstrate skills with packages included in the Anaconda distribution such as _'Pandas'_, _'Numpy'_, _'Matplotlib'_ and _'Seaborn'_.

The projects are compiled within the _'notebooks'_ folder and where applicable any datasets used are included within the _'data_files'_ folder.
